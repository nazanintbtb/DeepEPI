# DeepEPI
DeepEPI is a deep learning model designed to advance the study of Enhancer-Promoter Interactions (EPIs) using genomic sequences. By incorporating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformer blocks, our model aims to unravel the complex interplay between enhancers and promoters. DeepEPI employs innovative methods such as embedding layers for one-hot coding and multihead attention mechanisms to enhance the detection and interaction analysis of Transcription Factors (TFs).
# DATASET
Data_Augmentation.R
A tool of data augmentation provided by Mao et al. (2017). The details of the tool can be seen in https://github.com/wgmao/EPIANN.
We used this tool to amplify the positive samples in the training set to 20 times to achieve class balance.
# USAGE
## Need package
python3.7,  tensorflow==2.8, cuda and cuDNN if you have GPU
